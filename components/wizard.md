# Wizard

A multipage form that guides a user through a complex flow or a series of interrelated tasks. A wizard consists of a navigation pane, header, main content area, and action buttons.



## Properties



### activeStepIndex

> Index of the step that's currently displayed. The first step has an index of zero (0).
> If you don't set this property, the component starts on the first step and switches step automatically
> when a user navigates using the buttons or an enabled step link in the navigation pane (that is, uncontrolled behavior).
> 
> If you provide a value for this property, you must also set an `onNavigate` listener to update the property when
> a user navigates (that is, controlled behavior).
> 
> If you set it to a value that exceeds the maximum value (that is, the number of steps minus 1), its value is ignored and the component uses the maximum value.
> 

Type: Number

Required: No


### className

> Adds the specified classes to the root element of the component.

Type: String

Required: No


### i18nStrings

> An object containing all the necessary localized strings required by the component.
> - `stepNumberLabel` ((stepNumber: number) => string) - A function that accepts a number (1-based indexing),
>    and returns a human-readable, localized string displaying the step number in the navigation pane. For example, "Step 1" or "Step 2".
> - `collapsedStepsLabel` ((stepNumber: number, stepsCount: number) => string) - A function that accepts two number parameters (1-based indexing),
>    and returns a string responsible for the navigation summary on smaller screens. For example, "Step 1 of 3". The parameters are as follows:
>    - `stepNumber` (number) - The step number that the user is currently on.
>    - `stepsCount` (number) - The total number of steps in the wizard.
> - `cancelButton` (string) - The text of the button that enables the user to exit the flow.
> - `previousButton` (string) - The text of the button that enables the user to return to the previous step.
> - `nextButton` (string) - The text of the button that enables the user to move to the next step.
> - `submitButton` (string) - The text of the button that enables the user to submit the form.
> - `optional` (string) - The text displayed next to the step title and form header title when a step is declared optional.
>

  optional?: string
  previousButton: string

  stepNumberLabel: (stepNumber: number) => string
}
```


Required: Yes


### id

> Adds the specified ID to the root element of the component.

Type: String

Required: No


### isLoadingNextStep

> Renders the *next* or *submit* button in a loading state.
> Use this if you need to wait for a response from the server before the user can proceed to the next step, such as during server-side validation or retrieving the next step's information.
> 

Type: Boolean

Default: `false`

Valid values: `true | false`

Required: No


### steps

> Array of step objects. Each object represents a step in the wizard with the following properties:
> - `title` (string) - Text that's displayed as the title in the navigation pane and form header.
> - `info` (ReactNode) - (Optional) Area for a page level info link that's displayed in the form header.
>    The page level info link should trigger the default help panel content for the step. Use the [link component](link.md) to display the link.
> - `description` (ReactNode) - (Optional) Area below the form header for a page level description text to further explain the purpose, goal, or main actions of the step.
> - `content` (ReactNode) - Main content area to display form sections, form fields, and controls.
> - `errorText` (ReactNode) - (Optional) Error text that's displayed in a page level error alert.
>    Use this for rendering actionable server-side validation failure messages.
> - `isOptional` (boolean) - Specifies whether the step is optional or required. If set to `true`, the text from `i18nStrings.optional`
>    is rendered next to the `title` in the navigation step label and the form header title.
> 

Type: ReadonlyArray<WizardProps.Step>
