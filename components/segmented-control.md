# Segmented control (SegmentedControl)

Enables users to toggle between different ways a piece of content or data are formatted on the page.



## Properties



### ariaLabelledby

> Adds aria-labelledby to the component. Create a visually hidden element with an ID and set this property to that ID. If you don't want the label to be visible in narrow containers, use this property instead of `label`.

Type: String

Required: No


### className

> Adds the specified classes to the root element of the component.

Type: String

Required: No


### id

> Adds the specified ID to the root element of the component.

Type: String

Required: No


### label

> Defines the label of the entire segmented control. In the standard view (that is, all individual segments are visible),
> this label is used as `aria-label` on the group of segments. In a narrow container, where this component is displayed as a select component,
> the label is visible and attached to the select component, unless `ariaLabelledBy` is defined. Don't use `label` and `ariaLabelledBy` at the same time.

> - `iconName` (string) - (Optional) Specifies the name of the icon, used with the [icon component](icon.md).
> - `iconAlt` (string) - (Optional) Specifies alternate text for the icon when using `iconUrl`, or `iconName` without `text`.
>            This is required when you use an icon without `text`.
> - `iconUrl` (string) - (Optional) Specifies the URL of a custom icon.
