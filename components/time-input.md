# Time input (TimeInput)

A form element that enables users to enter an absolute time value.



## Properties



### ariaDescribedby

> Adds `aria-describedby` to the component. If you're using this component within a form field,
> don't set this property because the form field component automatically sets it.
> Use this property if the component isn't surrounded by a form field, or you want to override the value
> automatically set by the form field (for example, if you have two components within a single form field).
> 
> To use it correctly, define an ID for each element that you want to use as a description
> and set the property to a string of each ID separated by spaces (for example, `"id1 id2 id3"`).
>

> automatically set by the form field (for example, if you have two components within a single form field).

### disableBrowserAutocorrect
