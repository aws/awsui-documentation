> * `loading` (boolean) - Replaces the status icon with a spinner and forces the type to `info`.

> When a user clicks on this button the `onDismiss` handler is called.
> * `dismissLabel` (string) - Specifies an `aria-label` for to the dismiss icon button for improved accessibility.
> * `action` (ReactNode) - Specifies an action for the flash message. Although it is technically possible to insert any content,
> our UX guidelines only allow you to add a button.
> * `buttonText` (string) - Specifies that an action button should be displayed, with the specified text.
> When a user clicks on this button the `onButtonClick` handler is called. If the `action` property is set, this property is ignored.
> **Deprecated**, replaced by `action`.
> *`id` (string) - Specifies a unique flash message identifier. This property  is used in two ways:
> 1. As a [keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys) source for React rendering.
> 2. To identify which flash message will be removed from the DOM when it is dismissed, to animate it out.
